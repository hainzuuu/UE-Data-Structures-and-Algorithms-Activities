# UE-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Activities

## Overview

This repository contains various Python programs demonstrating fundamental data structures and algorithms. The implementations focus on stacks, queues, sets, lists, and object-oriented programming, showcasing practical applications in data management and problem-solving.

## About the Project

This project was developed in 2022 during my first year of college for the subject Data Structures and Algorithms. It includes multiple Python programs that explore key data structures such as stacks, queues, and sets while implementing constraints and validations for efficient data handling.
